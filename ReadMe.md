– Project

    ∗ You have to work in groups of 2-3 students to come up with a project idea, write a proposal and
    submit it by the due date in the calendar. Proposals should be well written and worth 5% of the
    15% for the project (10% is for the codes/report/presentation).

    ∗ The proposal should address the following:
        · Project title,
        · Dataset,
        · Project idea: Provide a clear description of the problem and your approach to solving it. This should be at least two paragraphs,
        · Brief description of the steps you will take to move from concept to validated approach,
        · You should reference at least a couple other related papers or web pages to your project topic.

    ∗ Each group should prepare and present their proposal during a short presentation (about 10
    minutes) in class.

    ∗ Late submission will be penalized 25% of the possible points for the entire submission for each 24
    hour period late.

    ∗ Project reports must be (preferably prepared in LaTeX) and submitted as a PDF file online.
    Hand-written submissions will not be accepted.

    ∗ Projects will be graded based on the difficulty of the topic, the achieved results, and completeness
    and clarity of reports.

    ∗ You can see a list of websites with datasets on Prof. MacLeod’s webpage: http://www.cs.usm.

    ∗ To get an idea of acceptable relevant topics, you can see a list of projects and their reports on
    this Stanford University’s webpage: http://cs229.stanford.edu/projects2016.html.
